# Linear Correlation in LM‚Äôs Compositional Generalization and Hallucination

How do LMs compose knowledge for generalization? Our work provides a linear correlation viewpoint on this question. Link to the paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04520](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04520)

## ‚ö°Fast Start

### FastLinearity.ipynb

We provide an example notebook ```FastLinearity.ipynb``` to fit the correlation matrix between the next token logits predicted from prompts ```X live in the city of``` and ``` X lives in the country of```. To explain the process, we sample 1000 Xs (For time efficiency, we use 10000 in our paper) from the LM's (```llama3-8b```) vocabulary and fit a linear regression between the logits.

By checking the weights inside the fitted weights, we can find a reflection of real-word knowledge composition

```python
Y1_name = " Tokyo"
idx = Y1_names.index(Y1_name)
top_jds = weights[idx].argsort()[::-1][:5]
top_Y2_names = [Y2_names[jdx] for jdx in top_jds]
print(Y1_name, top_Y2_names)
```

which outputs ```Tokyo [' Japan', ' Luxembourg', ' Netherlands', ' Belgium', ' Nederland']```. You might get a slightly different result because only 1000 samples are used for fitting. You can set the sample number higher like 10000 to get a more precise and stable result, which will also increase the running time.

### FastResilience.ipynb

We provide an example notebook ```FastLinearity.ipynb``` to show the linear regression fitted by the logits before the large-scale post-training well adapts to the LM after post-training. We use the evaluation result from the ```correlation``` function to demonstrate a resilient linearity against fine-tuning.
